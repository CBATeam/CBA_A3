CBA: License
==========================
license.txt   => GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v2

Any addon which calls CBA-defined functions need not be licensed under the GPLv2 
or released under a free software license. Only if you are directly including
CBA code in your addon's binarized PBO or redistributing a modified version of
CBA itself would your work be considered derivative and therefore be legally
required to be released under the terms of the GPL. (And there's no reason to
ever do either of these.)


Example startup parameters
==========================
For ARMA 3 Content, launch with -mod=@CBA_A3

*** KNOWN ISSUES ***
- CBA Keybinding requires a mission to be initialized to function properly. 
  This includes working in the main menu of Arma 3. Command-line parameters like
  -world=empty or -skipIntro will cause Keybinding to work ONLY in-game but NOT
  in the main menu of Arma.
